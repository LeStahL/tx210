# GenComp - Generate font textures that compress well.
Idea: Font is packed into a texture by means of
    (1) Generating a glyph index with offsets in the texture
    (2) Packing the glyph outline point data and control data to the texture
    (3) This gets compiled into the demo by including a header generated by gencomp.py
    (4) Gencomp optimizes executable size by choosing glyph size optimally
    
# Optimization
Have size as optimized parameter.
